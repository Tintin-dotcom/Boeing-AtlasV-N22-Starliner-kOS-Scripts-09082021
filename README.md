This is the Kerbal Operating System code for an Atlas-V N22 rocket launch, carrying the Starliner spacecraft to the ISS.

The code launches the Starliner spacecraft into a parking orbit.

The docking with the ISS has to be done manually.

The boot.ks file opens the kOS Terminal of the kOS processor directly after launching the vessel. This only works if you right-click the kOS processor attached to the Starliner spacecraft, and select boot file "boot.ks". This file has to be placed inside a "Boot" foder in the KSP/Ships/Script directory.

///NOTES///

-> The ISS has a high partcount, and sometimes explodes if you approach it, so make sure to quicksave before you get close to it.

-> The ISS craft file includes the Crew Dragon, Soyuz and Progress vehicles currently docked to the station.

-> The solar panels of the Soyuz and Progress are extremely glitchy, as you can see in the video.

-> Tested in Kerbal Space Program Version 1.12.2.
